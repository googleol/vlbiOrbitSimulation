# VLBI Orbit Simulation
    In the file, I will do three parts:
    1.Orbit Simulation
    2.Satellites' visibility for celestial area
    3.Satellites' visibility for ground station
    
#How to use this?

1.Download the whole file.
2.Open "HPOP" file for orbit simulation. Open Ground_Station_Access.py for Satellites' visibility for ground station. Open Visibility_for_Star.py for Satellites' visibility for celestial area.
3.try to understand the function HPOP and then try to use it.
4.Do not recommend use my designed GUI function, it is really slow.
5.This code is transfered from Matlab code. The original code is writtedn by Meysam Mahooti. You can download it in Matlab forum.
6.If you really need to use this code and have any questions, please contact me at xinrui.loveliu@gmail.com I am very happy to discuss it with you.
